-- Standing Poses

Warrior 1
{% highlight ruby %}
Stand facing forward.
Inhale and take a step back with one leg, letting the toes of your back foot point approximately forty-fix degrees to the side.
Raise your arms above your head, parallel to each other.
The front leg should be bent at the knee, foot flat, with the front shin approximately perpendicular to the floor.
The back foot should be flat on the ground. Hold the pose for three to five breaths.
{% endhighlight %}

Warrior 2
{% highlight ruby %}
From Warrior 1, open your arms and hips to face the side of your mat.
(If your right foot is back, open to right, and vice versa.)
Keep your arms parallel to the ground, "broadening" through the chest.
Hold the pose for three to five breaths.
{% endhighlight %}

Warrior 3 | Superman pose
{% highlight ruby %}
The goal this time is to move your torso forward while balancing on one foot, with the rest of your body parallel to the floor.
From a neutral standing position (regular standing or Warrior 1), raise your arms above your head, then lift one foot slightly off the floor.
Move that foot backward in space while leaning forward with your torso, hinging at the hip until you're in Superman position.
Focus on balancing with the muscles in your foot, and keep your bottom knee solid, but not locked.
Hold the pose for three to five breaths, then return to a neutral standing position.
